## 🧑‍💻 About Calum

Calum Bradley is a software engineer based in Cheshire, UK, who enjoys turning messy requirements into calm, predictable systems. He works across the full stack with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, SQL databases and DevOps tooling, with a particular interest in automation, CI/CD and keeping production outages comfortably boring. When he’s not shipping code, he’s usually out with his cocker spaniel, Chester, or trying to convince his golf handicap to go the right way.
